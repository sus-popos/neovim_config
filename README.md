Just Clone and Get my Neovim config (for Linux)

Steps:

  - run following commands in your terminal for installing Packer (Package manager for neovim)
    
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim \
   ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim

  - enter 'nvim' in your terminal to open
  - type ':PackerInstall' to install the plugins
  - modify as you wish and have fun enjoying neovim experience!   :)
